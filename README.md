# daughter_questions

This will be a place where I keep my daughter's wired questions. 


* Why wind could blow away light stuff (08/29/2018)
* Why we can not grow up to the sky
* Why people die and then where do they go
* Why the shape of the moon is similar to a banana
* Why do we have two nostrils, two hands, two legs, etc
